## Crowd flow Analysis and Predictive Modelling for Infrastructure Management

### Effective crowd control is crucial for improving total public space use and resource allocation in today's urban landscapes. The "Project FlowCast" is an all-inclusive solution designed to give insights into crowd dynamics using computer vision and machine learning. The project aims to help infrastructure management with well-informed judgments by using cutting-edge methods to identify, categorize, and evaluate crowds inside predefined zones.
