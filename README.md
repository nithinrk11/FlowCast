# FlowCast
## Crowd flow Analysis and Predictive Modelling for Infrastructure Management

### Effective crowd control is crucial for improving total public space use and resource allocation in today's urban landscapes. The "Project FlowCast" is an all-inclusive solution that gives insights into crowd dynamics using computer vision and machine learning. The project aims to help infrastructure management with well-informed judgments by using cutting-edge methods to identify, categorize, and evaluate crowds inside predefined zones.
This project is collectively developed with fellow group members Leo John Thomas as part of the Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP) undertaken by the Government of Kerala
